Submitted by: Domingo, Graciana Faye;  Elio, Lara Karmela; Rodriguez, Clarisse

This study aims to investigate the short run and long run equilibrium between the number of HIV cases in the Philippines and selected health and socio-economic determinants namely: number of registered marriages, number of deployed OFW’s, female population, number of barangay health stations, and number of private hospital beds in the Philippines. The data used for this study is from 1984-2014. After a series of preliminary procedures, the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) was found to be the most appropriate. The final model consisted of three cointegrating equations showing the long run relationship between HIV and the above mentioned variables. The results of this study showed that in reducing the number of HIV cases, construction of policies will be deemed the most effective if the focus would be on marriages and OFW’s.
